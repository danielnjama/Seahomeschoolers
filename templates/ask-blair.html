							<h2>Help with YOUR Homeschool!</h2>
							<p>Hello! I am Blair Lee. When my team suggested this column, I had no idea how popular it was going to be. They realized many homeschoolers want help, practical tips, and insights on their homeschool journey focused on the “how-to” advice I give in my conference talks. </p>
                            <p>Our community is filled with inspiration about the why of homeschooling. But, let’s face it, the practical how to do it is often missing, and this is the information you need most to be successful. Whether you’re a seasoned homeschooling parent looking for fresh ideas or a newcomer seeking help, I am here to support you on your educational journey. </p>
                            <p>We now get so many Ask Blair questions, the magazine cannot contain them all. Through this page, you will find Ask Blair articles from the magazine as we re-publish them. You will also find Ask Blair questions that are not in the magazine that were published directly on this page. The articles range from curriculum selection and time management to fostering social connections and creating a nurturing learning environment. Join me as we navigate the exciting realm of homeschooling together! </p>

							<p> Do you have a question for the fan-favorite column “Ask Blair” found in <a href="https://seahomeschoolers.com/secular-eclectic-academic-magazine/"> The SEA Homeschoolers Magazine?</a> Please use <a href="https://forms.gle/fhiGAHKbtsVC6Dwr7"> this form </a> to submit your homeschooling questions. The SEA team will select a few questions to be answered by SEA Homeschoolers Founder & Magazine Editor, <a href="https://seahomeschoolers.com/online-conference-series/blair-lee/">Blair Lee</a>, in each quarterly issue. Due to space, not all questions will be published in the magazine. Those that come in shortly after a magazine issue has been published will go on this page. These are important questions and we want to answer them for you in a timely way. Please be sure to include all pertinent information relevant to your question – examples: learner ages, grade levels, preferred resource format, topics of interest, preferred homeschool methodologies, state requirements you’re trying to meet, learning challenges, etc. </p>
